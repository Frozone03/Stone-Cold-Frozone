Hello there!  I am Alfonso Moceri, a first year student in the College of Engineering.  I have not declared a major yet, however, I am looking into the Data Science major.  I thought what would be a 
better way to figure out if data science is for me then getting first hand experience in it.  A fun fact about me is that my family is 100% Italian.
